# Data Visualisation- Percentage of male smokers vs Death in male with lung cancer 
 Data is obtained and modified from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). Only 2005's data is available in this dataset. I have combined two datasets(one for male smokers and one for death in male with lung cancer) into one. You can download it [here](http://www.sharecsv.com/s/ac4b3c8bbac132cad4012d15c2f929ad/lungcancer_2005.csv).
 
The main package used in this project is Plotly Express. The template for this code is very similar to ggplot2 in R programming. What's great of this package is that you will only need a few lines of code to create a simple visualisation, with the functionality of viewing the data points when hovered over. 
 
In this dataset, we studied if there is a correlation between male smokers and the death in male with lung cancer. The correlation obtained from this dataset is 0.209. This shows that there is no significant relationship between male smokers and the death in male with lung cancer. As this dataset only comprises of data in 2005, it is challenging to determine corelation.
